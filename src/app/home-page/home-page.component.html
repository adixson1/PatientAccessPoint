    <h3>Possible Risks/Complications</h3>

    <p>A new patient exam consists of routine tests and examinations, all of which are not expected to cause any pain.
    Some of them may be slightly uncomfortable at the most. All tests are also guaranteed safe for any patient, 
    regardless of age or health condition.</p>

        <p>Some patients may see new patient exams as stressful, uncomfortable, or awkward, which is understandable as they 
            will be meeting a new doctor and will be expected to divulge personal and private information about their health.

            who will serve as the patientâ€™s primary care provider. </p>
